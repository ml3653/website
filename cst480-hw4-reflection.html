        <h2>HW 4 Reflection</h2>
        <h3>UI</h3>
        <p> 
            1.  I think the hardest aspect of the login and authorization is getting the components to display when the user is logged in or not (via cookie). Nothing that I struggled with immensely, but using the cookie as a validation to ensure that the user could perform certain actions. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Login Endpoint</h3>
        <p> 
            1.  Did not have any particular issues with the backend-side. I think the most difficult part was adding cookies and being able to consider all of the cases where an account could not be created or the user could not login. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Security audit</h3>
        <p> 
            1.  For XSS mitigation, ensure all user inputs are validated and sanitized. <br>
            2.  Use CSRF tokens and SameSite cookie attribute to prevent CSRF attacks. <br>
            3.  Implement rate limiting either with a firewall or within the application code. <br>
            4.  Set HTTP headers like CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, and HSTS. <br>
            5.  Access controls implemented both on the client-side (e.g., in the UI) and the server-side (e.g., in the backend logic and database queries) to prevent unauthorized access and data exposure. <br>
        </p>
