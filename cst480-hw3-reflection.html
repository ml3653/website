        <h2>HW 3 Reflection</h2>
        <h3>UI</h3>
        <p> 
            1.	I integrated book and author editing and deleting into my design by adding buttons that sends put and delete requests respectively that uses the input fields as values. Since my retrieving the list of books does immediately and only updates once that GET button is clicked, the simple implementation would be is to add buttons that delete and puts rather than editing the table directly with its current functionality. <br></b> 
            2.	With my implementation of it, I did not really face any difficulties since all I did was add a button to perform that functionality (e.g. delete, or update). If the table was interactive, then it would have been more difficult to update the elements and update real-time.
        </p>
        <h3>Materials UI</h3>
        <p> 
            1.  Refactoring my UI to use Materials UI wasn't as bad as I initially thought. I was trying to use some of the sample code as provided on their website, which did not yield any results, so I ended up formatting it using the options such as "variant". It took a bit to understand the syntax but eventually I was able to create a navigation bar and revamp my existing buttons and tables. As previously mentioned, the pitfall I faced was trying to understand how the syntax worked and how I can use some of the imports from Materials UI since there is a lot. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Editing Endpoint</h3>
        <p> 
            1. It wasn't as difficult as adding the associated tests for the endpoints, but the more troubling aspect is that all of the tests have since failed and it would be difficult to fix and address all of them, which may have failed for a variety of reasons. Writing POST endpoints definitely made editing endpoints more easier as I didn't have to learn how to write the tests and how to set it up.
